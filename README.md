# agentd

A daemon that makes a desktop OS accessible to AI agents

## Install

Agentd is currently only tested on Ubuntu 22.04.

We recommend using one of our base vms which is already configured.

```bash
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/agentsea-vms/ubuntu_2204.qcow2
```

If you want to install on a fresh Ubuntu VM

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agentsea/agentd/main/remote_install.sh | sudo bash
```
